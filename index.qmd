I'm a research scientist at Virginia Tech's [Center for Biostatistics and Health Data Science](https://biostat.centers.vt.edu/). I received a PhD in Statistics and Analytics at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/program/statistics-analytics-phd) in 2024.  

My current methodological research interests include how to optimally cluster data objects into homogeneous subgroups when the number of clusters are not known a priori, and how to select informative features when building machine learning applications.  

With my biostatistics expertise, I collaborate with clinicians and public health researchers to answer critical questions in health- and medical-related domains to inform practice and policy.  

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.enarteynaatei@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects and collaborations.
